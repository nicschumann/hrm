# Hierarchical Reasoning Model

An implementation of [Hierarchical Reasoning Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21734) by Sapient Intelligence / Wang et al. The goal here is to reproduce various features of the paper while building a public implementation that's both readible and extensible to domains outside of the paper.
